Slota-Madurri Biconnectivity Components Coloring Algorithm - GPU Implementation

Biconnectivity decomposition algorithm that identifies articulation points and labels edges based on associated BCC.

Uses a coloring-based approach with spanning tree hybrid BFS, mutual parents, coloring, and labeling subroutines.
